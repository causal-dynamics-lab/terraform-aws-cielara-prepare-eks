Prepares your AWS account for a Cielara EKS deployment. Creates one
cross-account IAM role the Cielara control plane assumes via STS — gated by
a per-tenant External ID — with a service-scoped inline policy covering
exactly what the EKS data plane provisions. No long-lived access keys leave
your account.

## What it creates

| Resource | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| IAM role | `cielara_eks_deployer_<cielara-client-id>` | Identity the Cielara control plane deploys as |
| Inline role policy | `cielara_eks_deployer_<cielara-client-id>` | Service-scoped grant (EKS, RDS, EFS, Secrets Manager, ACM, ELB + supporting EC2/IAM) — not AdministratorAccess; IAM management is fenced to Cielara-named resources |
| S3 bucket + object | `cielara-infra-version-<cielara-client-id>` / `version.json` | Version marker the Cielara control plane reads (deployer role gets read via a bucket policy) |
| KMS key + alias | `alias/cielara-jwt-signing` | Customer-owned JWT signing key (ECC P-256) — its key policy explicitly denies the Cielara deployer roles sign and key administration. One key per `jwt_key_generation`; the alias targets the newest. See "Rotating or revoking the JWT signing key" |
| Credentials file | `cielara-creds.json` | The handback — upload it in the Cielara deploy form (written on fresh prepare and adoption alike) |

The role is named per tenant: each Cielara tenant onboarding into the same
AWS account gets its own role and trust policy. The KMS key is regional
(created in your active `AWS_REGION`) and shared across Cielara tenants in
the account.

## Usage

Requires Terraform >= 1.7 and an AWS identity with IAM-write permissions in
the target account (an `AdministratorAccess` identity, or one scoped to
`arn:aws:iam::*:role/cielara_eks_deployer_*`):

```bash
aws configure sso                    # one-time SSO setup
aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>    # or static keys via: aws configure
export AWS_REGION=<region>           # see "Pick a region and keep it"
```

The Cielara deploy form serves a generated `main.tf` — provider, backend
guidance, and this module pinned to the exact version your deployment
expects, inputs pre-filled. Drop it in an empty folder. Writing the call
yourself instead:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2" # see "Pick a region and keep it"
}

module "cielara_prepare" {
  source  = "causal-dynamics-lab/cielara-prepare-eks/aws"
  version = "X.Y.Z" # the exact version the Cielara deploy form names

  # Both values come from your Cielara tenant — the deploy form pre-fills them.
  control_plane_principal_arn = "<control plane principal ARN>"
  external_id                 = "<your per-tenant External ID>"

  region = "us-east-2" # must match the provider block

  # Recorded into the handback so Cielara can show where your Terraform
  # state lives: "local", or your remote backend URL (s3://bucket/key).
  state_storage_url = "local"
}
```

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The apply writes `cielara-creds.json` (holding the deployer role ARN and
the `storage_url` where your Terraform state is kept) into
the working directory — upload it in the Cielara deploy form to fill the
**Role ARN** field. Prefer pasting the value? Re-export the module output
(`output "role_arn" { value = module.cielara_prepare.role_arn }`) and
`terraform output -raw role_arn` prints it.

## Pick a region and keep it

The deployer role is global, but the JWT signing key and the infra-version
bucket below are both regional, so the region this module runs in becomes part
of the account's state. `region` is a required module input — it is not
inferred from `AWS_REGION`, because an operator's shell silently
deciding where the signing key lives is exactly the failure it prevents: the
key's alias ARN is regional and the control plane builds it from the deploy
form's region, so a mismatch fails at the first login. Keep it identical on
every run —
otherwise a later apply from a differently-pointed shell tries to create the
bucket again in the new region and fails with:

```
Error: creating S3 Bucket (cielara-infra-version-<client-id>): api error
AuthorizationHeaderMalformed: The authorization header is malformed;
the region 'us-east-1' is wrong; expecting 'us-east-2'
```

The region S3 says it is "expecting" is where the bucket already lives. Set
`region` to that value. With `migrate = true` the existence check reports the
same mismatch up front, naming the region to set.

## Infra-version marker

The apply also creates a tiny S3 bucket,
`cielara-infra-version-<cielara-client-id>`, holding a single `version.json`
that records which version of this module ran (`0.0.0-dev` on an untagged
checkout). A bucket policy grants the deployer role read on just this bucket
so the Cielara control plane can tell the prepare vintage without asking you.

There is no customer-side read check here: the role's trust policy only lets
the Cielara control plane assume it (by design), so the read is verified by
Cielara at deploy time.

## Keep your Terraform state

The state holds no secret — the role has no long-lived credential — but
keep it anyway:

- **Never send the state to Cielara** — Cielara never needs it.
- Local state is fine for a single operator. For a team, configure a remote
  backend in your own cloud account — see "Remote state" below.
- **Keep the state.** Cielara occasionally extends the prepare resource set;
  re-applying this module (at the version the Cielara UI links) picks the
  additions up in place.
- Lost the state? Re-adopt the existing resources with `migrate = true`
  (see below) — do not delete or recreate anything.

### Remote state

Terraform ignores backend blocks inside a published module — the backend
belongs in your root module, next to the `module` call. The Cielara-generated
`main.tf` carries one already: filled in when your deployment has a recorded
state location, commented out otherwise. Writing it by hand:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "<your-terraform-state-bucket>"
    key    = "cielara-prepare/eks/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "<bucket-region>"
  }
}
```

Any backend pointing at storage you own works — the other clouds' backends
are just as good. Adding it after a local-state apply: run `terraform init
-migrate-state` once.

## Already prepared with the script, or lost your state?

The role import ids derive from your Cielara client id and the JWT signing
key resolves through its alias, so there is no discovery step. Terraform only
allows `import` blocks in the root module, so they cannot ship inside this
module: the generated `main.tf` from the deploy form's "already prepared"
toggle carries them, keyed on this module's `probe_*` outputs, alongside
`migrate = true`. Use that file (writing the call by hand means copying its
import blocks too), then:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Check the plan: it must show only the 2 imports plus new creations (the
`cielara-creds.json` handback and the infra-version bucket resources, which
postdate the scripts) — nothing changed, nothing destroyed. If an earlier run
of this module already created the infra-version bucket (lost state), the
module detects that — the check runs `aws s3api head-bucket` via
`check-version-marker.sh`, so migrations need the AWS CLI authenticated —
and the generated file's import block adopts the bucket too. Adopting an
account prepared **before the JWT signing key existed**? Re-run the latest
prepare once first (idempotent) — the adoption imports expect the key and
alias to exist. Then:

```bash
terraform apply
terraform plan   # must print: No changes.
```

Active Cielara deployments are untouched — the role and its trust policy
are adopted exactly as they are.

## Rotating or revoking the JWT signing key

**Rotation needs `jwt_key_generation` incremented, and nothing else.** The
variable names the live generation; the alias always targets the highest one.

```hcl
jwt_key_generation = 2 # module argument — was 1
```

Everything a rotation has to get right comes with that: the new ECC P-256 key
carries the deployer-Deny key policy and the `cielara-jwt-signing` tag the data
plane's signer is authorised against, and `alias/cielara-jwt-signing` moves to
it. Cielara is not involved and cannot perform or undo it. The data plane
begins signing with the new key within its ~5-minute key cache.

**A rollback needs the number decremented** — earlier generations stay enabled
precisely so that stays possible. The generation you drop is scheduled for
deletion, recoverable inside the KMS deletion window.

**Revoking a generation needs it disabled**, which drops it from the data
plane's published keys at the next cache refresh:
`aws kms disable-key --key-id <arn from jwt_signing_key_arns_by_generation>`.

**Rotation needs no hand-made keys.** A key created with the AWS CLI gets AWS's
default key policy, which delegates to account IAM where the Cielara deployer
roles hold `kms:*` — that hands Cielara the ability to sign as you. It also
lacks the tag the signer is authorised against, so signing stops instead.

Sessions issued before a rotation need a fresh login, a few minutes later, once
every verifier's key cache has turned over. Nothing else is affected.

## Revoking access

```bash
terraform destroy
```

removes the role and its policy; the Cielara control plane immediately
loses access to the account. Only do this for deployments you have already
destroyed through Cielara. The JWT signing key is not deleted instantly: destroy
schedules its deletion with AWS KMS's mandatory waiting period, so the alias and
key linger until it elapses.

## TLDR / CLI

```bash
mkdir cielara-prepare-eks && cd cielara-prepare-eks
# Download the generated main.tf from the Cielara deploy form into this folder.

aws sso login --profile <profile> && export AWS_PROFILE=<profile>

# Already prepared (script or lost state)? Use the deploy form's "already
# prepared" toggle — the downloaded file carries migrate = true and the import blocks.

terraform init
terraform plan     # migrating: only imports + the marker additions, 0 destroy
terraform apply
terraform plan     # must print: No changes.
# handback: cielara-creds.json -> Cielara deploy form (or `terraform output -raw role_arn`)
```
